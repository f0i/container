# Dev Container

Something similar to [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) build with docker-compose and a few simple bash scripts.

## Install

Requires docker, docker-compose and some basic tools like git, bash and ssh.

The commands `bin/dev` should be somewhere in your PATH.

1. Assuming a project called `allkinds` in `~/projects/allkinds`
2. Clone this repo into the project root `dev allkinds init`
3. Modify the `Dockerfile` to include the services and tools you need
4. Build the docker container using the command `dev build`
5. Start the docker container with `dev start`
6. Connect to the container with `dev` and start development
7. Enable port forwarding to the host `dev ports 3000 8080:80`,
   in this case port 3000 and 8080 of the host will be forwarded to port 3000 and 80 of the container

## Comparision to Development Containers

- Less dependencies: Only docker, docker-compose, git, bash and ssh
- Easier to understand what is going on:
  - Main script is `bin/dev`: ~160 lines of bash, mostly if/else and case statements, no loops
  - Port forwarding in `bin/ports`: ~30 lines of bash, starting a ssh tunnel with `ssh -L ...`
  - Docker-compose file: ~20 lines of yaml, defining services and volumes
  - Dockerfile: ~10 lines, defining the base image and define which tools to install by default
  - Setup scripts called from Dockerfile or run manually in `setup/`: ~5-30 lines of bash each

You are supsed to modify the Dockerfile and setup scripts to fit your needs.
